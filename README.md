## üíé Porfolio

### RAG using AWS Bedrock and AWS Polly
A system using AWS Bedrock and AWS Polly creates a "smart assistant" that answers questions based on your private documents and speaks the answers aloud. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find relevant information in your files before generating a response, ensuring the answers are accurate and context-specific.

The entire workflow is orchestrated by an AWS Lambda function, exposed securely through Amazon API Gateway. The architecture was meticulously designed for efficiency and low cost, maximizing the use of the AWS Free Tier and offloading the expensive Speech-to-Text processing to the browser's native Web Speech API. This project serves as a practical demonstration of building scalable, cost-effective, and cutting-edge AI solutions on the cloud.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection: An End-to-End Analysis
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that develops and compares fraud detection models on a highly imbalanced credit card transaction dataset. This system demonstrates a full data science workflow, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to training and evaluating traditional (XGBoost) and deep learning models. The solution emphasizes using business-centric metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to overcome the challenge of misleading accuracy, ultimately identifying a robust and production-ready model for real-world application.

### Social Media üåê
Social Network Project developed using Node.js, React, JavaScript, and MongoDB, incorporating real-time chat and AI features to elevate user engagement. This platform was designed to create a vibrant social environment where users can securely connect, communicate, and benefit from AI-driven assistance. MongoDB serves as the primary database, providing flexibility and scalability for managing user data, posts, chat histories, and AI-generated interactions efficiently.

The project features secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), protecting user access, while the real-time chat functionality is enabled through Socket.io, ensuring instant message delivery and seamless communication. The AI assistant, integrated via API, enhances user experience by offering personalized responses.

### To Be Hero X Sentiment Analysis
A data-driven project designed to analyze and visualize fan community opinions on the anime series To Be Hero X. Leveraging a powerful Python toolkit, the project uses PRAW to scrape Reddit data, Hugging Face Transformers for state-of-the-art sentiment analysis, and presents the findings in a dynamic web dashboard built with Streamlit and Plotly. The analysis has a dual focus: exploring the reception of each character and tracking the evolution of audience sentiment throughout the season, episode by episode.
