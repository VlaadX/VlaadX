## üíé Porfolio

### Social Media üåê
Social Network Project developed using Node.js, React, JavaScript, and MongoDB, incorporating real-time chat and AI features to elevate user engagement. This platform was designed to create a vibrant social environment where users can securely connect, communicate, and benefit from AI-driven assistance. MongoDB serves as the primary database, providing flexibility and scalability for managing user data, posts, chat histories, and AI-generated interactions efficiently.

The project features secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), protecting user access, while the real-time chat functionality is enabled through Socket.io, ensuring instant message delivery and seamless communication. The AI assistant, integrated via API, enhances user experience by offering personalized responses.

### RAG using AWS Bedrock and AWS Polly
A system using AWS Bedrock and AWS Polly creates a "smart assistant" that answers questions based on your private documents and speaks the answers aloud. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find relevant information in your files before generating a response, ensuring the answers are accurate and context-specific.

The entire workflow is orchestrated by an AWS Lambda function, exposed securely through Amazon API Gateway. The architecture was meticulously designed for efficiency and low cost, maximizing the use of the AWS Free Tier and offloading the expensive Speech-to-Text processing to the browser's native Web Speech API. This project serves as a practical demonstration of building scalable, cost-effective, and cutting-edge AI solutions on the cloud.
