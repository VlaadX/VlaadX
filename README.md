### Story Craft üìñ

Web System Project developed as part of an undergraduate research project aimed at fostering a love for reading in children through the use of Generative AI. The system allows children to shape their reading experience by providing input on the story‚Äôs main character, setting, conflict, context, and other narrative elements. Based on these inputs, the AI generates a story tailored to the child‚Äôs imagination, bringing their creative vision to life.

This system was developed with the dual purpose of promoting literacy and sparking imagination by encouraging children to actively participate in the storytelling process. In addition to generating custom narratives, the AI creates illustrations for each paragraph, designed to reflect the story's progression and enhance the child's engagement through visual storytelling.
